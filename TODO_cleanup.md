# TODO - Project Cleanup

## Files to Delete
- [ ] register.html - Registration page not used with demo accounts
- [ ] folder.html - Folder management redundant with upload.html functionality
- [ ] upload_enhancements.css - Additional CSS not essential for core functionality
- [ ] data/local_storage_spreadsheets_sample.js - Sample data not needed in production

## Notes
- Missing/corrupted files from open tabs (cors_proxy.js, admin_animations.js, clear_table_data.html, cors_proxy.php, notifications.js) are already not present in the directory
- Core application files preserved: index.html, menu.html, login.html, admin.html, upload.html, spreadsheet.html, style.css, package.json, etc.
